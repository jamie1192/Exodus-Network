# Warmind for Destiny 2

An Android companion app for Destiny 2, that utilises the Bungie API to allow players to access and manage their Destiny 2 
characters' inventories, see their stats for various in-game activities and clan functionality (pending API access).

Players can also utilise the LFG functionality to submit a Looking-For-Group post to find other people to play with to fill their
group for Raids/PVP/Weekly activities.

# OAuth
